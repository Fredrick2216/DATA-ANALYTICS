# ⚡ Clean Energy Growth in Indian States (2015–2025)

## 📊 Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes a decade of **clean energy transformation in India**, focusing on investments, renewable energy capacity, policy effectiveness, and population dynamics across all states from **2015 to 2025**.

With rich interactive dashboards, the project helps uncover **how different states have accelerated (or slowed) in clean energy adoption**, driven by investments, state policies, and energy per capita trends.

---

## 🚀 Tools Used
- **Visualization Tool:** Microsoft Power BI Desktop  
- **Data Sources:** Enhanced clean energy dataset (CSV format)  
- **Techniques Applied:**
  - DAX Measures (e.g., Investment Growth Trends)
  - Conditional Formatting & Trend Arrows (↑ / ↓)
  - Slicers and Drillthrough Filters
  - Interactive Tooltips
  - Dynamic Cards & Treemaps

---

## 📌 Dataset Highlights
The dataset includes the following metrics per state/year:
- `Investment_Million_INR`
- `Total_Renewable_Capacity_MW`
- `Per_Capita_Capacity_MW_per_Million`
- `Policy_Score_10` (0–10 rating)
- `Population`
- `State`, `Year`

---

## 🌟 Key Insights
- 🟢 **Chhattisgarh** and **Arunachal Pradesh** lead in per capita renewable energy capacity.
- 🔺 Investment trend arrows dynamically indicate states improving or declining.
- 📉 Some states, despite high populations, lag in renewable output — indicating policy/potential gaps.
- 🧠 Policy scores correlate with investment in certain regions, showing effective policy deployment.

---

## 🧠 What You'll Learn
- How to create data-driven dashboards in Power BI.
- Use of **DAX** to calculate trends over time.
- Effective storytelling using cards, slicers, maps, and custom visuals.
- Making data accessible for non-technical users with **interactive UX**.

## ✨ Future Enhancements
- Integrate real-time APIs for updated investment data.
- Add geo-map with dynamic zoom (once org permissions allow).
- Include forecasting visuals (2026–2030) using Power BI’s decomposition trees or AI visuals.
